Overview of the Project:
Project Title: Multithreaded Chat Application

Project Overview:
The Multithreaded Chat Application project is a Java-based client-server application that enables real-time communication between multiple clients connected to a server. The project utilizes Java Sockets and multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently.

Project Objectives:
1. Design and implement a client-server architecture using Java Sockets.
2. Utilize multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently.
3. Enable real-time communication between clients connected to the server.

Project Features:
1. Client-server architecture using Java Sockets.
2. Multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently.
3. Real-time communication between clients.
4. Simple broadcast approach to send messages to all connected clients.

Project Benefits:
1. Demonstrates the use of Java Sockets and multithreading in a real-world application.
2. Provides a basic understanding of client-server architecture and real-time communication.
3. Can be extended to include additional features such as user authentication and message encryption.

Project Scope:
The project scope is limited to designing and implementing a basic client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading.

Project Timeline:
The project timeline is assumed to be short-term, with a completion duration of a few days to a week.

Project Deliverables:
1. A functional client-server chat application with multithreading.
2. A documentation of the project, including an overview, features, and usage instructions.
